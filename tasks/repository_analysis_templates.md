## üéØ Context-Specific Rule Templates

### Team Size Customizations

#### Solo Developer Rules
```markdown
## Solo Developer Focus

### Context Switching Management
- Document every architectural decision
- Include "why" in all major code comments
- Keep TODO comments with dates and context
- Update RULES.md after every significant change

### Future-Self Guidelines
- Write code assuming 6-month memory gap
- Include setup instructions for development environment
- Document debugging procedures for common issues
- Maintain project diary in context files
```

#### Small Team Rules (2-5 people)
```markdown
## Small Team Coordination

### Communication Patterns
- Use pull request descriptions to explain approach
- Tag relevant team members for architecture decisions
- Weekly RULES.md review for updates
- Shared responsibility for documentation updates

### Review Process
- All changes require one approval
- Focus on knowledge sharing during reviews
- Use pair programming for complex features
- Rotate code review responsibilities
```

#### Large Team Rules (5+ people)
```markdown
## Large Team Governance

### Formal Processes
